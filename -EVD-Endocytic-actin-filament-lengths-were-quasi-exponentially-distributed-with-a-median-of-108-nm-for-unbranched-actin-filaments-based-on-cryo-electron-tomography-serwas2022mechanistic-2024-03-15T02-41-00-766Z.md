## Grounding Context [â„¹](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/akamatsulab/page/oSV9jmPLG)  
  - Note that the distribution is not especially exponential, due to there being few filaments with lengths <60 nm. Unclear if this is due to choice of what to manually segment, or is representative of the dataset.  
  - ### Figure Legend:  
    - > Figure 2. CME-actin networks consist of branched and unbranched filaments  
    - > (B) Segmentation models of the tomograms in (A), bottom row shows branched actin filaments only. Color-coded legend describes elements shown in the models.   
    - > (C) Filament length distribution of unbranched and branched filaments across all CME events shown in this publication. Median filament length for unbranched and branched actin filaments are highlighted. Scale bars, 50 nm in (A and B).  
  - ### Sentence from Results:  
    - > we measured a median branched filament length in tomograms of 59 nm, indicating that these filaments could have assembled over the course of a CME event (Figure 2C; Table S3). This possibility is further supported by the relatively low number of branched filaments in the early-stage CME tomogram shown in Figures 2A and 2B.  
    - > Unbranched filaments were longer and had a median length of 108 nm (Figure 2C; Table S3). Some of the unbranched filaments likely represent filaments that existed before the onset of the CME event, for example, as part of the actin cortex. However, a subset of these unbranched filaments could have been newly polymerized and also contributed to force generation to support CME progression.  
    - > _The early CME site in the tomogram in Figure 2 showed the lowest number of branched actin filament clusters, suggesting that more branched actin clusters are initiated and assembled during the plasma membrane internalization phase._  
    - > The presence of unbranched filaments at early stages of CME suggests that they might represent pre-existing cortical actin filaments (earlystage site in Figure 2, CME invaginations in Figure S2) or filaments originating from other nearby actin structures like the bundle in the late-stage tomogram in Figure 2. These dense cortical actin arrangements might represent a physical barrier that needs to be cleared by filament severing, disassembly, or repositioning for CME progression. Shorter filaments might be ones that are diffusing through the cytoplasm (Chen and Pollard, 2013; Aroush et al., 2017). _Importantly, some of the unbranched filaments might be actively producing assembly forces at CME sites as well as acting as mother filaments for new branch formation._

    - **Cryo-electron tomography data acquisition **  
    - > Samples were imaged on a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope (FEI) ...Samples were visually inspected for ice quality using the FEI flu cam. Overview grid maps were acquired at 0.2 mm pixel size. If samples were imaged by cryo-fluorescence light microscopy before, these grid maps were used to identify cells of interest from the cryo-fluorescence light microscopy overview maps. For random data collection, cells with thin cell regions were located. For both types of data collection, polygon maps of the regions of interest with an overlap of 20-25% between individual images were recorded. The polygon maps were used to pick tilt series acquisition points either at random or based on fluorescent signal from cryo-fluorescence light microscopy. The hole pattern of the carbon film was used as a guide. Acquisition points were chosen with adequate distance between individual points to prevent electron dose exposure damage prior to data collection. Only cellular regions without obvious sample damage (e. g., through blotting) were used for data collection. SerialEM (Mastronarde, 2005) in low-dose mode was used for automatic tilt-series recording using a bidirectional tilt scheme starting at +20 and with a typical tilt range from +60 to -60 and base increment of 2. Pixel sizes between 2.97 and 3.72 A ÌŠ were used. Target defocus was varied between -2 and -8 mm and the targeted total electron dose was 100 e-/A ÌŠ 2 (see Table S1 for acquisition parameter details of individual tomograms presented in here). Data was collected in super resolution mode on the K2 detector or in 0.5 binning mode on the K3 detector. Frame time was 0.2 â€“ 0.25 s. Note that at the beginning of the project, the Leica cryo-CLEM microscope was not available to us and we therefore used the double-tagged fluorescent SK-MEL-2 cell line to verify that CME occurs in cells growing on holey carbon grids by fluorescence microscopy.

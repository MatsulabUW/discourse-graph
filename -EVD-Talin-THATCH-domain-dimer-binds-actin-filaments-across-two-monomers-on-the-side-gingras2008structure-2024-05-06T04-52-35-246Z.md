# [[EVD]] - Talin THATCH domain dimer bound actin filaments across two monomers on the side - [[@gingras2008structure]]
##  Summary  
  - > Using electron microscopy, extra density was visible decorating the actin filaments at both pH 7.0 and 7.5 in the presence of the talin construct (Figure 5A arrows), clearly indicating binding. @gingras2008structure

  - > The model places the two helical bundles towards two opposite sides of the filament. The upper bundle is placed close to subdomain 2 of the central actin monomer and is also close to the back (C-terminal region) of subdomain 1 of the upper actin monomer and the top of subdomain 1 of the central actin monomer. The lower talin helical bundle is close to the lowest actin monomer of the three-monomer interaction site. The dimerisation domain is close to the N terminus (subdomain 1) of the central actin monomer. In this configuration, residues implicated in actin binding by the mutagenesis experiments are placed close to the surface of F-actin.  <br/>@gingras2008structure  

## Grounding context  
  - it's pretty low resolution (30 angstroms maybe?)  
  - > Two complementary image-reconstruction approaches for helically symmetric structures were applied to two independent data sets. The analysis of the resulting three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions shows that the helical symmetry is consistent with the values reported for decorated actin filaments by us and others. However, difference mapping of reconstructions of F-actin with and without talin 2334–2541 did not provide any clear difference peaks that might correspond to the talin domain.<br/> @gingras2008structure  
  - > we used an image analysis approach that does not rely on helical symmetry. The resulting 3D reconstruction shows two distinct but connected densities attached to the filament (Figure 5C). These densities are fully consistent in shape and size with the helical bundle of the talin C-terminal domain. In fact, the SAXS-based dimer model fits nicely into the extra density (Figure 5D), indicating that the conformation of actin-bound dimers and dimers in solution are similar. A minor twist (20°) around the dimerisation domain (Figure 5B) improves the fit dramatically and also increases contact area with the actin filament. The docking indicates that the talin domain binds to three monomers along the filament. <br/> @gingras2008structure

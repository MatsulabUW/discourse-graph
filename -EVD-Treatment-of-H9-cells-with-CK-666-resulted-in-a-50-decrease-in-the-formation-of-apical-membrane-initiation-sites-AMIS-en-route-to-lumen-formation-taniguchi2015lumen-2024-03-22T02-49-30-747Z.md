    - > (G) hESCs were treated with graded concentrations of the ARP2/3 inhibitor, CK-666 in the presence of 10 μM Y-27632 to prevent cell death. Quantitation of lumen formation at the two-cell stage is shown. Student’s t test was performed to assess differences in lumen formation at different concentrations of all inhibitors; 2.5 μM was used as the baseline for Y-27632 and blebbistatin in (B), while DMSO was used as the baseline for (C) and (G). The Student’s t test was utilized for statistical analysis: ns = p > 0.05; ∗p ≤ 0.05; ∗∗p ≤ 0.01, and ∗∗∗p ≤ 0.001. For all images, blue indicates DNA staining (DAPI). For small-molecule quantitation in (B), (C), and (G), 50 two-cell clones were counted per independent sample (total of 150 for the three samples) for each concentration. Error bars indicate SD.  
  - Sentence from Results:  
    - > Treatment of H9 cells with CK-666, a small-molecule inhibitor of ARP2/3 ([Nolen et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213671115003124?via%3Dihub#bib13)), resulted in a significant decrease in AMIS formation ([Figure 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213671115003124?via%3Dihub#fig4)G). Additionally, resulting lumens were smaller in size ([Figures 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213671115003124?via%3Dihub#fig4)A and 4D), suggesting that ARP2/3-induced actin branching is critical for AMIS formation.

    - > Human PSC cyst formation assays<br/>The hESC and hiPSC lines were cultured and maintained as described (Ludwig et al., 2006), using lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDEV)-free hESC-qualified Geltrex (Life Technologies, derived from reduced growth factor ECM extracted from murine Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma cells similar to Matrigel) to prepare ECM-coated plates. For the 3D assays (Figure 1A), the bottom of the glass chamberwell plates (LabTek) were thinly coated with 100% ice-cold Geltrex, and plates were incubated at 37oC for 30min to cure the gel. For the 2D experiments, glass coverslips were coated with 1% Geltrex for 1 hour at room temperature. To prepare singly dissociated hESC, the hESC monolayer was dissociated using Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 minutes and triturated using a P1000 pipetman to ensure single cell dissociation. Cells were then resuspended in PBS, centrifuged, resuspended in mTeSR1 (Stem Cell Technologies) containing 2% Geltrex and 10μM Y-27632 (EMD Millipore) unless otherwise noted, and were plated at 5,000 cells/cm2 on 100% Geltrex coated chamber-well plates (3D) or on 1% Geltrex coated coverslips (2D). Some experiments were performed using 1% Geltrex-coated coverslips, without 2% Geltrex overlay (Figure 1F and 1G). To test alternative substrates, some experiments were performed in 2D conditions using dissociated cells, plated sparsely in mTeSR1 on coverslips thinly coated with either 1% Geltrex, Matrigel (diluted as suggested by the manufacturer, Corning) or 10µg/ml vitronectin (Trevigen). In some cases, cells were plated on irradiated MEFs, plated at 20,000 cells/cm2 . Cell lines used for analysis on MEF had been historically maintained on MEF. In the case of H9, which were originally derived on MEF, an H9 derivative was adapted to feeder free conditions in the lab of J.S. at passage 35 and has been maintained under those conditions for more than 20 additional passages. The line has been repeatedly tested for pluripotency and examined for karyotype. We obtained these feeder-free cells at passage 50 for use in cyst assays in the absence of MEF. Additionally, the original H9 line, maintained on MEF, were examined (Figure S4). In the case of H1, H7 and HSF-6, these lines were maintained historically on MEF, but were also adapted in our laboratory to feeder-free conditions. We then compared the efficiency of cyst formation under feeder-free conditions with cyst formation in the presence of feeders for each line.

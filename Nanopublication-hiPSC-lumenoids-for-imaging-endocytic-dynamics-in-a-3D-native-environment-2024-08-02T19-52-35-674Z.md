# Nanopublication/hiPSC lumenoids for imaging endocytic dynamics in a 3D native environment
### Abstract  
  - (Adapted from ISCRM Stem Cell Symposium 2024)  
  - Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture is increasingly being used as a model to study cell and tissue organization and behavior in an environment that more closely resembles what cells encounter _in vivo_ (Figure 1.A). [Habanjar et al. (2021)](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/akamatsulab/page/xFTN0tzaC) While previous work has shown stable and reproducible formation of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lumenoids in extracellular matrix (ECM) gels, [Taniguchi et al. (2015)](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/akamatsulab/page/XFvcRaqrU) 3D human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lumenoid culture is relatively unexplored.  
  - Non-tagged and endogenously tagged hiPSCs were passaged according to established culturing and maintenance protocol. (Angelique Nelson, Stephanie Q Dinh, Kaytlyn Gerbin, Melissa Hendershott, Caroline Hookway, Ruwanthi N Gunawardane 2021. Maintenance of Undifferentiated hiPSC Cultures and Differentiation to Cardiomyocytes on Glass Surfaces. protocols.io https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.wjmfck6) <br/>The hiPSCs in this study were WTC-10 and WTC-11 cells, originally from the Conklin lab (Gladstone Institutes). Gene edited-cell lines were created in the Drubin Lab (UC Berkeley).<br/>Single cell or clump suspension was mixed at varying dilutions with Matrigel (Corning® Matrigel® Matrix, Phenol Red Free, Cat `#356231`). Matrigel/Cell mixtures were seeded glass-bottom 8-well plates (µ-Slide 8 Well, ibidi, Cat`#80826`) for fluorescence imaging or in 70µm channels (µ-Slide Chemotaxis, ibidi, Cat`#80326`). Confining cells to a channel was intended to grow lumenoids of consistent size in an easy-to-image focal plane. Fluorescent imaging was carried out on a ZEISS Lattice Lightsheet 7.  
  - We found that hiPSC cells seeded in ECM gel formed lumenoid 3D structures resembling those seen in epithelial 3D culture. Cells that were seeded in Matrigel formed regular lumenoids 3 days after seeding as single cells and remained a polarized monolayer surrounding a lumen for up to 5 days after seeding (Figure 1.B). Varying the matrigel concentration at seeding changed the average lumenoid size. We found that cells confined in channel slides in 5.9 mg/mL Matrigel formed lumenoids that were consistent in size (67 $$\pm$$ 16 µm) after three days and were 50% larger in size compared to cells seeded in 4.4 mg/mL matrigel (42 $$\pm$$ 10 µm) (Figure 1.C). Finally, we demonstrated the suitability of these lumenoids for fluorescence microscopy to investigate endocytic dynamics using Lattice Light Sheet Microscopy (Figure 1D).  
  - In conclusion, this reproducible method to grow gene-edited hiPSC-derived lumenoids allows us to culture healthy, diploid human cells in a tunable environment that’s mechanically and physiologically closer to that in human tissue.

### Background/Discourse Context:  
  - **Introduction**  
    - 3D culture is a tool to study cells in a three-dimensional environment that more closely resembles the native environment of cells in human tissues ([Habanjar et al. (2021)](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/akamatsulab/page/xFTN0tzaC))  
    - Some cells form a "lumenoid," a single cell layer formed around a "lumen" [cit]  
    - Previous work has shown that human embryonic stem cels (hESCs) form lumenoid structures after 3 days and retain their pluripotency status   
      - EVD - Lumenoids formed over 3 days in hESCs - @taniguchi2015lumen  
    - EVD - Single MCF10A cells cultured with Cultrex UltiMatrix BME showed superior "acini" formation (increased size and consistency) compared to Cultrex BME, Type R1 and Matrigel.  - @CultrexPoster2020  
    - In this work, we sought to explore whether human induced pluripotent stem cells form lumenoid structures when cultured in an extracellular matrix gel, and whether it can be used as a reproducible model to study endocytic dynamics in 3D culture.  
    - Research questions:  
      - @TC/WTC-11 lumenoids in matrigel vs geltrex vs culturex  
      - @TC/Will growing lumenoids in confined ibidi channels allow for better consistent growth and focal plane of lumenoids?  
      - QUE - How and when do hiPSCs lumenoids form?

      - RES - Cells grown in matrigel within ibidi's chemotaxis channel slide with a height of 70 µm, in a 2:1 matrigel:cell suspension matrix, grew into lumenoid formations by day 2 after seeding and reached 67 $$\pm$$ 16 µm size at day 3 while seemingly being all in a single focal plane. - @TC/Will growing lumenoids in confined ibidi channels allow for better consistent growth and focal plane of lumenoids?

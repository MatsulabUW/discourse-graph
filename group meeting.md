  - If time: How is the current group meeting format going? Anything we'd like to change/try?   
    - One idea could be to have a "deep dive" for one lab member once a month (instead of the round table recap)?  
    - Abhi: Santana lab does optional 45min slots  
    - Maggie: AICS: 2h meeting no matter what; quick general update for folks (a figure, this is what I'm seeing, ...) and then 2x25 minutes for a longer update  
    - Continuing the experiment!   
      - Longer form:  
        - Other people might want to hear more background  
        - Preparing for a presentation   
        - Optional, expectation that you can take up that time and encouraged do this at least once a year!   
        - [x] Valerie will set something up!   
  - Next week is the last week of the quarter!

    - Notes (Abhi):  
      - Looking at the timing of actin assembly relative to scission (yeast).  
      - Lots and lots of quantitative information to look through in @sirotkin2010quantitative.  
      - A great synthesis effort leading to a claim! CLM - Actin assembly peaks 8 seconds before endocytic scission  
    - Also for mammalian cells:   
      - @taylor2011high  
  - Abhi  
    - QUE - What are the mechanisms by which actin networks adapt to increasing loads at sites of endocytosis?  
      - biochemical signaling leading to actin assembly could be altered in response to load (timing, strength of signaling, etc)  
      - geometrical constraints i.e. from @mueller2017load:

      - load propagation through the network regulating actin binding proteins - e.g. from @jegou2021mechanically:

      - global modulation of key network parameters e.g. capping, severing, crosslinking  
        - twinfilin (CPI motif containing protein) regulates capping rate at the lamellipodium @hakala2021twinfilin  
      - ** load dependent properties of molecules: is force-responsiveness of the system an emergent property of the force-response of the components? **  
        - related to the actin cytoskeleton - there are many e.g. force-attenuated capping, force-attenuated filament growth etc. - @li2022molecular  
        - independent of the actin cytoskeleton  
    - QUE - What is the impact of force-dependent capping on the force-producing capability and load adaptability of endocytic actin networks?  
    - In looking at the plots of internalization vs time across conditions Current to-do list:, we hypothesized that HYP - Force-attenuated capping increases the internalization velocity of endocytic sites.  
      - Plotting time to median internalization for no_fac (vs) fac at baseline and elevated membrane tension:  
      - RES - Implementing FAC = 0.8828 pN-1 in endocytosis simulations did not significantly change the time to median internalization, both at baseline and elevated membrane tension - @cytosim/vary force-dependent capping in endocytosis simulation. - @experiment  
      - RES - Implementing FAC = 8.828 pN-1 in endocytosis simulations did not significantly change the time to median internalization, both at baseline and elevated membrane tension - @cytosim/vary force-dependent capping in endocytosis simulation  
      - Does seem like there are some simulations with reduced time to median internalization with FAC, just not statistically significant with the current testing.  
    - Currently working on:  
      - HYP - Force-attenuated capping increases the internalization velocity of endocytic sites:  
        -  ISS - Plot the internalization velocity from times 0-5s, 5-10s, and 10-15s in the simulations.  
      - HYP - Force-attenuated capping decreases the variability of endocytic internalization as well as actin assembly metrics  
        - Looked at box plots of last time point internalization:  
          - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fakamatsulab%2Fyfd8GB59m6.png?alt=media&token=4729f5c8-ee8f-4abe-97bc-8b1a98d75b7b)

          - Seems to oppose the hypothesis! Need to quantify this (Coefficient of Variation is a potential starting metric).  
          - More results of this type to quantify are cataloged in @cytosim/code documentation.  
    - Notes:  
      - May 14th general exam!!  
      - 4 hypothesis to answer the question on mechanisms:  
        - geometrical constraints: without capping, the actin filaments all grow, reach the membrane, and exert force, regardless of orientation. Without capping, only the "shortest path" filaments reach the membrane and exert force but the other filaments lab behind and get capped (?)  
        - differential regulation depending on the forces exerted on the filament (tension, bending, torque)  
        - (...)  
      - color coding the individual runs allows for double checking of individual runs to ensure internalization is approx. same - so that difference_ in time to median internalization_ isn't just due to a difference distance (nm) internalized  
      - Potential plot: each run individual (on one graph) and put a point for each median so you'll end up with kind of a scatterplot of the medians  
      - This analysis addresses ISS - Report internalization velocity in endocytic simulations  
      - Look at some videos! fac vs no fac  
      - Ideas: ISS ISS - Classify some internalization vs time traces in different conditions, and see if you can distinguish (predict) one type of event versus another

        - Great! Let's focus on the new results listed in these notes. Please contextualize each result so that the other lab members can appreciate and understand it. You should take advantage of any questions or hypotheses listed that are closely associated with the result.  
        - Assistant: In the notes, various results are intertwined with ongoing questions and hypotheses, providing a snapshot of the lab‚Äôs current research landscape. Here‚Äôs how each of these findings can be contextualized for broader lab comprehension, including their links with related questions or hypotheses.<br/><br/>### 1. **Result Contextualization: Implementing Force-Dependent Capping (FAC)**<br/><br/>- **Result**: Implementing FAC = 0.8828 pN-1 and 8.828 pN-1 in endocytosis simulations did not significantly change the time to median internalization at baseline and elevated membrane tension.<br/>- **Associated Hypothesis**: HYP - Force-attenuated capping increases the internalization velocity of endocytic sites.<br/>  <br/>**Contextualization**: This result directly relates to our exploration of how the mechanics of actin networks adapt during endocytosis, particularly under varying loads. Previous hypotheses suggested that force-attenuated capping (FAC) might speed up the internalization process by fine-tuning actin polymerization in response to membrane tension. The current findings challenge this notion, indicating that the implementation of FAC, across tested levels, does not markedly affect the speed of endocytic vesicle internalization. This unexpected result prompts us to revisit our understanding of FAC's role in actin dynamics and suggest that other factors, possibly mechanical properties of the membrane or actin network itself, may be more critical in regulating the pace of endocytosis.<br/><br/>### 2. **Result Contextualization: Variability in Endocytic Internalization and Actin Assembly**<br/><br/>- **Result**: Contrary to expectations, increased force-dependent capping did not decrease the variability of endocytic internalization or actin assembly metrics.<br/>- **Associated Hypothesis**: HYP - Force-attenuated capping decreases the variability of endocytic internalization as well as actin assembly metrics.<br/>  <br/>**Contextualization**: The variability in endocytic internalization rates and actin assembly dynamics is a crucial aspect of how cells adapt to different physical and biochemical environments. The hypothesis posited that increasing force-dependent capping would standardize these processes by providing a more uniform actin polymerization response across different cells or conditions. The observed results, showcasing unchanged or even increased variability, suggest a more complex landscape of actin dynamics regulation. It could imply that the adaptability of the actin network to mechanical cues is not solely moderated through capping mechanisms but might involve a variety of actin-binding proteins and signaling pathways. This unpredicted outcome opens new avenues for exploring how cells maintain robustness and flexibility in their endocytic machinery.<br/><br/>### Contextualizing these results within the overarching research framework highlights their significance in advancing our understanding of cellular mechanics. It not only underlines the importance of these findings in challenging previous assumptions but also sets the stage for further inquiries into the multifaceted regulation of actin dynamics and endocytosis. Engaging with these results encourages lab members to refine existing models, design targeted experiments to probe newly arising questions, and appreciate the complexities inherent in cellular adaptation mechanisms.  
        - Fantastic! Can you provide suggestions about what follow-up simulations or analyses we might want to do in light of these two results?  
        - Assistant: Given the unexpected findings related to force-dependent capping and its effect on endocytic internalization and actin assembly dynamics, there are several follow-up simulations and analyses that can be pursued to deepen understanding and refine hypotheses. Here are suggestions for each of the result areas:<br/><br/>### 1. **Follow-ups for Force-Dependent Capping and Internalization Velocity**<br/><br/>- **Refine Simulation Parameters**: ISS - Adjust the range of force-dependent capping parameters (FAC) within simulations.<br/><br/>- **Incorporate More Complex Mechanical Interactions**: Enhance the simulation models to include additional mechanical properties such as membrane tension heterogeneity, actin filament bending stiffness, and varying crosslinking densities. This could reveal nuanced effects of FAC under more physiologically relevant conditions.<br/><br/>- **Investigate Temporal Dynamics**: Conduct simulations that explicitly model the temporal dynamics of actin cap formation and disassembly. Observing how changes in the timing of these events affect internalization could provide insights into the critical temporal windows where force-dependent capping has the most influence.<br/><br/>- **Cross-species Comparisons**: Perform analogous simulations using parameters tailored to different cell types or organisms to explore if the observed independence of internalization velocity from FAC is a universal phenomenon or if it varies across biological contexts.<br/><br/>### 2. **Follow-ups for Variability in Endocytic Internalization and Actin Assembly**<br/><br/>- **Quantify Individual Variability Components**: Apply statistical or computational methods to decompose the observed variability into sources (intrinsic vs. extrinsic factors, stochasticity in biochemical reactions, etc.). This could highlight specific areas where force-dependent capping might play a more pronounced role.<br/><br/>- **Spatial Modeling of Actin Networks**: Develop simulations that account for the spatial organization and architectural dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. Tracking how localized changes due to FAC influence global network properties could uncover mechanisms that contribute to or mitigate variability.<br/><br/>- **Machine Learning Analysis**: Utilize machine learning techniques to analyze large datasets from simulations or experiments to identify patterns or features associated with reduced variability in internalization and actin assembly metrics. This approach might reveal unexpected factors influencing these dynamics.<br/><br/>- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to determine how variability in endocytic internalization and actin assembly metrics is affected by altering key model parameters, including but not limited to FAC. Identifying parameters with high leverage effects can guide experimental focus.<br/><br/>### General Considerations for Both Areas<br/><br/>- **Collate and Compare with Experimental Data**: Wherever possible, validate simulation results with available experimental data or collaborate to design new experiments that can test predictions arising from simulations. This iterative approach between theory and experiment can refine models and hypotheses.<br/><br/>- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Engaging with experts in computational biology, biophysics, and systems biology can introduce novel methodologies or perspectives that enhance the modeling and analysis of these complex systems.<br/><br/>Pursuing these follow-up actions will not only address the immediate questions raised by the current results but also enrich the broader understanding of actin dynamics and endocytosis, potentially leading to novel insights about cellular behavior and regulation.  
        - Wonderful. We'll go with "adjust the range of force-dependent capping parameters within simulations." What should we report in the simulations? What hypothesis are we testing with this in-silico experiment? List a specific, previously listed hypothesis if possible.  Finally, if a new member of the lab wants to carry out this experiment, what additional context or links should they have, to understand the basis for this task?  
        - Assistant: For the follow-up in-silico experiment focusing on adjusting the range of force-dependent capping parameters within simulations, here is a structured approach to guide the planning, execution, and analysis:<br/><br/>### Hypothesis to Test<br/><br/>The specific hypothesis you would be testing with this in-silico experiment is:<br/><br/>- HYP - Force-attenuated capping increases the internalization velocity of endocytic sites.<br/><br/>This hypothesis is based on the premise that modulating the force dependency of actin filament capping can influence the speed at which endocytic vesicles are internalized.<br/><br/>### Metrics to Report in Simulations<br/><br/>When carrying out the simulations after adjusting the force-dependent capping parameters, it's crucial to report on metrics that directly contribute to understanding the impact of these adjustments on endocytic dynamics. These metrics might include:<br/><br/>1. **Internalization Velocity**: Measure and report the speed of vesicle internalization under varying force-dependent capping parameters. This is directly related to testing the hypothesis at hand.<br/>   <br/>2. **Actin Polymerization Rate**: Document changes in the rate of actin filament polymerization, as this could be a mediating factor influenced by force-dependent capping that affects internalization velocity.<br/><br/>3. **Membrane Tension**: If possible, measure the changes in membrane tension before and after internalization, as this could provide insights into how force-dependent capping interplays with membrane mechanics to affect endocytic processes.<br/><br/>4. **Variability in Endocytic Metrics**: Assess and report the variability in internalization velocity and actin assembly metrics across simulations, providing insights into the robustness and reliability of force-dependent capping effects.<br/><br/>5. **Time to Median Internalization**: Document the time it takes to reach median internalization across varying conditions, offering another angle to evaluate the impact of adjusted capping parameters.<br/><br/>### Context and Resources for New Lab Members<br/><br/>For new lab members tasked with carrying out this experiment, it's beneficial to provide a comprehensive background on the subject matter along with specific resources. These might include:<br/><br/>- **Background Literature**: Key articles and reviews on endocytosis, actin dynamics, and the role of force in cellular processes. Notable examples include:<br/>   - The original papers listed in the initial context, such as the work by [@sirotkin2010quantitative] and [@sun2019direct], to get grounded in the current understanding of actin and endocytic dynamics.<br/>   - Literature on the mechanisms of force-generation in cells and the importance of actin capping, for a theoretical basis.<br/><br/>- **Technical Tutorials and Workshops**: Access to tutorials or internal workshops on the specific simulation tools and software being used (e.g., Cytosim) can be instrumental.<br/><br/>- **Data Analysis Resources**: Guidance on statistical methods and software (e.g., R, Python) for analyzing simulation outcomes, particularly focusing on metrics of interest as mentioned above.<br/><br/>- **Mentorship and Group Meetings**: Regular meetings with a mentor or within the research group to discuss progress, challenges, and insights can greatly accelerate the learning curve and integration of new members into the project.<br/><br/>- **Code Repositories and Documentation**: Access to previous simulation codes, parameters, and documentation. Having a central repository where past and current simulation codes are stored, along with detailed documentation of parameters, outcomes, and analysis scripts, can provide invaluable context and starting points.<br/><br/>Equipping new members with these resources and context ensures a solid foundation for contributing meaningful results to the project and facilitates a smoother integration into the research team's efforts to probe the complexities of cellular mechanics.

        - Assistant: ### Introduction to the Task and Significance<br/><br/>Welcome to the lab! You're embarking on an exciting journey to explore the intricate dance of cellular processes, focusing on the mechanistic details of endocytosis. Endocytosis is a fundamental cellular process through which cells internalize a portion of their plasma membrane, along with extracellular materials, into vesicles for various purposes, including nutrient uptake, signal transduction, and membrane recycling. Among the myriad of factors that orchestrate this process, the actin cytoskeleton plays a pivotal role, providing the necessary force for membrane invagination and vesicle scission.<br/><br/>Your task involves running in-silico experiments to adjust the range of force-dependent capping parameters within simulations. This is based on the hypothesis HYP - Force-attenuated capping increases the internalization velocity of endocytic sites, positing that the modulation of actin filament capping in response to mechanical force influences how quickly endocytic vesicles are internalized. This hypothesis sits at the crossroads of biophysics and cellular biology, aiming to uncover how physical properties at the molecular level translate to macroscopic cellular behaviors. <br/><br/>### Specific Metrics to Report<br/><br/>From the simulations, you'll focus on reporting three specific metrics:<br/><br/>1. **Internalization Velocity**: This measures the rate at which endocytic vesicles are internalized. It's a direct reflection of endocytic efficiency and is central to testing our hypothesis. <br/><br/>2. **Variability in Endocytic Metrics**: Observing and quantifying the consistency or variability in internalization velocities across different simulation runs provides insights into the robustness of force-dependent capping effects and their impact on endocytosis.<br/><br/>3. **Time to Median Internalization**: Analyzing the time it takes for vesicles to reach a median state of internalization under various force-dependent capping conditions could reveal thresholds of actin dynamics regulation critical for efficient endocytosis.<br/><br/>### Specific Predictions to Test<br/><br/>This experiment will allow us to test several key predictions:<br/><br/>- If force-dependent capping directly influences internalization velocity, increasing the capping parameter within certain ranges should correlate with increased rates of vesicle internalization.<br/>- A reduction in the variability of internalization metrics across simulations with adjusted force-dependent capping parameters, suggesting a stabilizing effect of force modulation on endocytosis.<br/>- A decrease in the time to median internalization as force-dependent capping parameters are optimized, indicating a more efficient endocytic process under these conditions.<br/><br/>### Additional Context<br/><br/>Given your background in biology and introductory programming, you're well-placed to navigate both the biological complexities and computational aspects of this project. You will leverage your biology knowledge to understand the cellular processes at play and apply your programming skills to run and analyze simulations. <br/><br/>To further contextualize your task and help you integrate into our ongoing projects seamlessly, it would be beneficial to familiarize yourself with foundational studies and key methodologies. Reviewing @sun2019direct and @sirotkin2010quantitative will provide a deeper understanding of actin dynamics and endocytic processes. Additionally, getting comfortable with our simulation tool (e.g., Cytosim) and data analysis software will be crucial. Don't hesitate to reach out to team members for discussions, clarifications, and tech tips. Collaboration and curiosity are the keys to unlocking the mysteries of the cell.<br/><br/>Engaging with this task not only contributes to our collective effort to elucidate cellular mechanics but also offers you a unique opportunity to develop a multidisciplinary skillset, bridging biology and computational science‚Äîa valuable asset in the ever-evolving field of computational biology.  
        - This is looking good! It's okay to be informal and excited, but I think that terms like "intricate dance" and "unlocking the mysteries of the cell" sound kind of general and hokey. Can you rephrase those parts of the text, and also include a mention of the existing experiment @cytosim/vary force-dependent capping in endocytosis simulation, and rewrite these paragraphs?  
        - Assistant: Absolutely, let's refine the text with a more direct approach while incorporating the mention of the existing experiment.<br/><br/>### Task Introduction and Significance<br/><br/>Welcome aboard! You're stepping into an important project at the intersection of cell biology and computational modeling, particularly focusing on the process of endocytosis. This critical cellular function allows cells to ingest external materials and recycle membrane components, with the actin cytoskeleton playing a crucial role by providing the force needed for the membrane to invaginate and eventually pinch off into vesicles.<br/><br/>Your task is to delve into in-silico experiments by adjusting the range of force-dependent capping parameters within simulations. This investigation is inspired by the hypothesis HYP - Force-attenuated capping increases the internalization velocity of endocytic sites, which suggests that tweaking how actin filaments are capped in response to mechanical forces can change the speed at which cells internalize membrane vesicles. By conducting these simulations, you'll help us understand if and how mechanical forces at the molecular level can influence large-scale cellular behaviors.<br/><br/>This effort builds upon our ongoing experiments, specifically @cytosim/vary force-dependent capping in endocytosis simulation, where we've started exploring how variations in capping affect endocytic dynamics. Your work will extend these findings, providing fresh insights and potentially confirming or challenging our existing understandings.<br/><br/>### Metrics to Focus On<br/><br/>In your simulations, you should concentrate on three main metrics:<br/><br/>1. **Internalization Velocity**: A direct measure of how quickly endocytic vesicles are internalized. This is key to understanding the efficiency of endocytosis under different conditions.<br/><br/>2. **Variability in Endocytic Metrics**: Observing the consistency or range of differences in internalization velocities across simulations can tell us a lot about the possible stabilizing effects of force-dependent actin capping.<br/><br/>3. **Time to Median Internalization**: This measures how long it takes for vesicles to reach a midpoint in internalization, providing another perspective on the efficiency of the endocytic process under varying force-dependent capping parameters.<br/><br/>### Predictions to Test and Additional Context<br/><br/>Through this experiment, we aim to put several predictions to the test:<br/><br/>- Adjusting the force-dependent capping parameters should show a direct correlation with internalization velocity, where particular adjustments could lead to faster vesicle internalization.<br/>- We might observe less variability in internalization metrics with specific adjustments to the capping parameters, indicating a potential stabilizing influence on the endocytic process.<br/>- Optimizing force-dependent capping parameters could decrease the overall time required for median internalization, reflecting a more streamlined endocytic pathway.<br/><br/>Given your background, you're in a great position to tackle both the biological concepts and computational challenges of this project. Reviewing the details of our existing experiment @cytosim/vary force-dependent capping in endocytosis simulation will give you a head start. Also, familiarizing yourself with key papers, like those by [@sun2019direct] and [@sirotkin2010quantitative], and mastering the simulation tools, will be crucial. Please feel free to reach out to anyone in the team for discussions or help‚Äîyou're now part of a collaborative effort aimed at clarifying how cells modulate endocytosis in response to mechanical forces. Your contributions here have the potential to significantly advance our current understanding and inform future research directions in cell biology.

 They put all of their measurements on the same time scale using time 0 as the time that patches started to move from the surface, which we assume coincided with endocytic internalization 
 From this i'm claiming that  CLM - Actin assembly peaks 8 seconds before endocytic scission

 ** load dependent properties of molecules: is force-responsiveness of the system an emergent property of the force-response of the components? **

 independent of the actin cytoskeleton
 QUE - What is the impact of force-dependent capping on the force-producing capability and load adaptability of endocytic actin networks?
 In looking at the plots of internalization vs time across conditions Current to-do list:, we hypothesized that HYP - Force-attenuated capping increases the internalization velocity of endocytic sites.
 Plotting time to median internalization for no_fac (vs) fac at baseline and elevated membrane tension:
 RES - Implementing FAC = 0.8828 pN-1 in endocytosis simulations did not significantly change the time to median internalization, both at baseline and elevated membrane tension - @cytosim/vary force-dependent capping in endocytosis simulation. - @experiment
 RES - Implementing FAC = 8.828 pN-1 in endocytosis simulations did not significantly change the time to median internalization, both at baseline and elevated membrane tension - @cytosim/vary force-dependent capping in endocytosis simulation
 Does seem like there are some simulations with reduced time to median internalization with FAC, just not statistically significant with the current testing.
 Currently working on:
 HYP - Force-attenuated capping increases the internalization velocity of endocytic sites:
  ISS - Plot the internalization velocity from times 0-5s, 5-10s, and 10-15s in the simulations.
 HYP - Force-attenuated capping decreases the variability of endocytic internalization as well as actin assembly metrics
 Looked at box plots of last time point internalization:

 Seems to oppose the hypothesis! Need to quantify this (Coefficient of Variation is a potential starting metric).
 More results of this type to quantify are cataloged in @cytosim/code documentation.
 Notes:
 May 14th general exam!!
 4 hypothesis to answer the question on mechanisms:
 geometrical constraints: without capping, the actin filaments all grow, reach the membrane, and exert force, regardless of orientation. Without capping, only the "shortest path" filaments reach the membrane and exert force but the other filaments lab behind and get capped (?)
 differential regulation depending on the forces exerted on the filament (tension, bending, torque)
 (...)
 color coding the individual runs allows for double checking of individual runs to ensure internalization is approx. same - so that difference_ in time to median internalization_ isn't just due to a difference distance (nm) internalized
 Potential plot: each run individual (on one graph) and put a point for each median so you'll end up with kind of a scatterplot of the medians
 This analysis addresses ISS - Report internalization velocity in endocytic simulations
 Look at some videos! fac vs no fac
 Ideas: ISS ISS - Classify some internalization vs time traces in different conditions, and see if you can distinguish (predict) one type of event versus another

 did another transfection of GRAF1 constructs, will be imaging tomorrow
 Met with entire committee and solidified general exam date May 28!
 synthesizing background items to re-frame for my project and exam
 Mag' notes on abhi-- Arp2/3 preferentially nucleates actin polym on convex membrane
 @risca2012actin
 Notes:
 working on QUE - What are the similarities and differences between CLIC/GEEC and CME?
 QUE - What is a specific marker on the plasma membrane for CLIC/GEEC endocytosis?
 QUE - What nucleation promoting factor activates Arp2/3 in CG endocytosis?
 Current experiment is @imaging/GRAF1_constructs_transfection
 in [human induced pluripotent stem cells](https://stemcell.ucla.edu/glossary/induced-pluripotent-stem-cells) ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell))
 TODO AS you're finding ese insigthsnd observations, share with lab at lab meetings!
 Matt:
 Finished @AWS/parallel computing workflow implementation!
 made Protocol/AWS parallel simulations
 Moved onto @cytosim/vary Arp2/3 complex periodicity and spring stiffness
 Ran 693 simulations üòÑ

x is Arp2/3 binding periodicity
 Now running through parallel simulation plotting pipeline
 Mag notes: longstanding goal of AWS setup, complete!!!
 AWS is crazy. Can run tons of simulations at once (in parallel) and it all happens elsewhere and very fast

 Not discussed:
 @PCR/Junctional PCR validation of ArpC3-TagGFP2 clones 1-60
 Part of Project/ArpC3-TagGFP transfection and ddPCR characterization of WTC-11 Cells (too many questions to list)
 I will be thawing clones next week (!)
 @TC/Evaluating cell and colony morphology on substrates with different stiffness and ECM coatings.
 Will pilot this experiment with CellBrite 650 and ECGreen
 Related to:
 QUE - How does substrate stiffness affect the dynamics of endocytosis?
 QUE - What is the relationship between substrate stiffness and membrane tension?
 QUE - Does actin concentration at endocytic sites depend on substrate stiffness?
 @analysis/Analyzing the demo microscopy images for cells using MATLAB for 2 channel spot detection and tracking in 2D
 Related to i.e. QUE - Are there differences in endocytosis dynamics related to cell location?
 Pipeline runs well, just haven't figured out how to make sense of the data that comes out!
 Will learn the new pipeline tomorrow! 
 Mag notes for valerie:
 40x objective still under testing-- fluorescence looks better than with the 20x on the isohub, but going to test the demo 20x to see if we can image on plastic and glass and get eenough infor to be useful
 Danish:
 Major structure of the pipeline is complete (with possibility of addition of improvements along the way) (Tested on 2GB movie so far)
 https://github.com/Mdanishnadeem/Image-Analysis-Tracking/tree/main
 Show the final outlook of the filtered tracks dataframe (notebook 06)
 Future work 
 Adjust few parts of the pipeline to handle big data files (10GB plus) as this cannot be handled directly in memory and would cause a standard machine to crash.
 Problems being faced currently (for channel 1 and channel 3, channel 2 is fine)
 Dimensions are also different for channel 1,3 and channel 2 
 (1, 1, 116, 2052, 340) (Channel 2)
 (1, 114, 2048, 337) (Channel 3 and Channel 1)

 Notes from Valerie
 Probably not possible to run large datasets on a local machine because it loads all the data; workaround is to use something similar to virtual stacks in Fiji. Can tweak the current code so it can work using the Allen Institute system (AICS image.io)
 Added some more variables, including a note for how many channels a track correlates with, and z information
 We will likely want to be able to input czi and tiff 
 FYI -- I found it!:
 ** 3-2-1 data storage rule**
 have 3 different copies
 on 2 types of devices
 of which 1 is offsite
 Notes (matt)
 git clone git@github.com:Mdanishnadeem/Image-Analysis-Tracking.git
 conda create --name cme_pipeline python==3.10
 conda acitvate cme_pipeline 
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 things to add:
 time (in seconds)
 position (in nm)
 check out importing these metadata on AICSimageio!
 sort the heatmaps based on lifetime
 so that you can see the distribution of events
 sort the heatmaps based on length of time before peak

  - ![The image presents a contour plot, which is a graphical representation where lines of constant values are drawn in a coordinate system. To describe this to a biologist or biophysicist, we'll focus on the axes and the color scale.<br/><br/>The horizontal axis, labelled "Branch periodicity," is given in nanometers (nm). This axis likely represents a spatial frequency or a structural periodicity in a biological context – possibly referring to the repeat distance between structural features in a biological specimen, such as the periodic branching of certain biomolecules, cytoskeletal elements, or membrane structures.<br/><br/>The vertical axis, labelled "Membrane tension," is given in picoNewtons per nanometer (pN/nm). This axis quantifies the tension applied to or present within a biological membrane. Membrane tension is a critical physical parameter influencing the behavior of cellular membranes, affecting processes like membrane fusion, fission, trafficking of vesicles, and the organization of membrane proteins.<br/><br/>The color scale on the right, with values ranging from 0 to 80, is labelled "% internalization". This implies that the color contours represent the degree of internalization, possibly of a membrane component or a vesicle within a cell, expressed as a percentage.<br/><br/>The contour plot provides a two-dimensional landscape where each color corresponds to a different level of internalization, depending on the combination of branch periodicity and membrane tension. For example, areas in blue indicate high levels of internalization (>60%), while areas in yellow and orange represent](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fakamatsulab%2FtX7B8c0p1B.png?alt=media&token=6e154822-6d42-4e0d-b47c-c45a46c3797c)

    - **Assistant:** **Title:** Simulated Pit Internalization Increased with Decreasing Values of Branch Periodicity and Membrane Tension<br/><br/>**Result Description:**<br/>The result from the simulated experiments in Dr. Akamatsu's lab at the University of Washington shows a clear relationship between the actin dynamics in endocytosis and the biophysical properties of actin filaments. Specifically, using a range of parameters for branch periodicity and membrane tension in the simulations, the research team observed a substantial increase in pit internalization as the values for branch periodicity decreased and membrane tension diminished.<br/><br/>**Figure Panel Analysis:**<br/>The contour plot provided visualizes this relationship in a two-dimensional parameter space, where the x-axis represents the branch periodicity (in nm) and the y-axis logarithmically represents the membrane tension (in pN/nm). The color gradient indicates the percentage of internalization with dark blue showing lower percentages and yellow to red indicating higher percentages reaching up to 80 nm. High internalization rates (>50 nm, yellow to red regions) are notably prevalent at lower branch periodicity and lower membrane tension zones, suggesting these conditions favor efficient pit internalization.<br/><br/>**Detailed Interpretation (Based on experiment log entries):**<br/>1. **Simulation Parameters and Setup:** The simulations were configured to explore the impact of the Arp2/3 complex binding periodicity on the actin architecture during endocytosis. Specifically, the team adjusted the simulated membrane tension across a broad range, observing how these variables influenced the internalization depth of endocytic pits. This setup was inspired by ongoing questions in the field regarding how actin dynamics can affect membrane curvature and force generation during clathrin-mediated endocytosis.<br/><br/>2. **Experimental Observations and Adjustments:** Over the course of the experiments, which were rigorously logged in Roam Research for transparent and evolving knowledge management, the team noted several adjustments. For example, they shifted simulation environments and refined computing resources to accommodate extensive simulation runs. This also included tweaks to the simulation protocol to improve accuracy and computational efficiency.<br/><br/>3. **Analysis Techniques:** Utilizing AWS cloud computing and parallel simulation protocols enabled the handling of massive datasets and complex computational tasks. The analysis involved detailed parsing of simulation outputs to extract meaningful metrics on pit internalization, which were then visualized in the provided contour plots.<br/><br/>4. **Interpretation and Context:** It is important to note that these results are based on simulated data, which, while highly informative and indicative of potential biological behaviors, would need to be confirmed through empirical biological experiments. The observed trends suggest a potential mechanistic insight that lower periodicity in Arp2/3 branch formation and reduced membrane tension might facilitate the membrane deformation required for pit deepening during endocytosis.<br/><br/>By contextually integrating day-to-day observations, experimental adjustments, and iterative data analysis, this research highlights the nuanced interplay between cellular structural components and the mechanical forces at play during the complex process of endocytosis. The findings may contribute to a deeper understanding of cellular mechanics in a biophysical framework, providing a valuable base for future experimental designs both in simulation and in vivo/in vitro models.
